					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>Hi, my name is Shravan Kumar Sheri and I am a Cyber Security Engineer. I have recently completed my B.E in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors in Information Security from Chandigarh University in India. I am currently pursuing my M.ENG in Cyber Security from the University of Maryland in College Park, MD. </p>
					<p>During my time at Fair Isaac and Company in Bengaluru, India, I worked as a Cyber Security Engineer where I handled all the configurations, security automation scripts, playbooks, and incident mappings on XSOAR which led to optimizing and improvising SOAR in detecting and classifying security alerts. I revised and tailored multiple detection rules on Splunk and Microsoft ATP for detecting different kinds of malicious signatures which strengthened the detection methodologies. I formulated more than 20 SOPs for assisting SOC team for investigating APT, phishing, and malware type of incidents, thus increasing the range of security detection procedures of the company. Additionally, I collaborated with the red and threat intel team for strategizing and securing current architecture of the company. I performed log analysis, forensic analysis, and malware analysis for business-critical incidents such as cloud abuse reports and zero days.</p>
<p>As a Cyber Security Intern at Fair Isaac and Company, I performed in-depth security analysis on all types of security alerts in a 24/7 rotational shift and received the best ticket of the month consequently for 4 months. I helped in preparing the threat intelligence report by researching and utilizing different threat intelligence tools and websites. I also presented technical analysis on new vulnerabilities and attacks in the company every weekend to improve awareness and collaborated with the Incident Response team for improving the security architecture of the company.</p>
<p>Aside from my professional work, I have also gained several certifications, including CompTIA Security+, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and Information Security Certified Professional. I am skilled in several programming languages, including Python, PowerShell, and Bash, and I am well-versed in frameworks such as NIST and MITRE. I have experience with various security tools and platforms, including Splunk, XSOAR, XDR, ATP, Intsights, Netography, Snort, Bro, nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp suite, FTK, Ghidra, IDA, and security VMs and platforms such as Flare VM, Cuckoo, GRR, Velociraptor, Linux, and Windows.</p>
